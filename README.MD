# RedcapData: Data Quality Assurance of Redcap Repositories

## Preface

> Data quality is an important albeit often ignored aspect of data management. 

> Data entry should be validated and a corresponding error report generated to strengthen the validation process. This should also be supported by periodic DQA. 

> During DQA, records are sampled after which data is entered into a separate repository. The next step is to perform concordance analysis to verify whether data was properly captured. In this case, the DQA repository serves as the gold standard.

  repo_token = "repo-token", 
  dqa_token = "dqa-token", 
  repo_api_url = "http://localhost/redcap/api/", 
  local = F
  )

dqaRes = audit(dqaObj)
